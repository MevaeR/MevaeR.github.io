## AI Pacman (Reinforcement learning)

It is the science of descision making, find the optimal way to make decision.

Reinforcement learning sits at the intersection of many different field of science

The reward system, with the neurotransmiter dopamine reflect what an algorithme will do.

In reinforcement learning is different form supervised and unsupervised machine learning because there is no supervisor to tell the system the right action to take. It is a trial error paradigm with rewards signal. The feedback from the taken actions can be delayed by many steps. You make a decision now and maybe in many step later you got to see if it was a good decision or bad decision. It is also a sequential decision making processing. One step after an other, the agent gets to make decision, pick action, see how much rewards it gets and optimize those rewards to obtain the best possible outcome.

Exemple of reinforcement range from playing video/board games to managing an investment portfolio and more importantly playing Atari games better than humans.

### Principe

The most fundamental quantity in RL is the rewards that is a scalar feedback signal, here name R_{t}.
