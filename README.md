### Introduction

**Reinforcement learning** is a machine learining area to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. 
**Reinforcement learning** is different from supervised and unsupervised machine learning because there is no "supervisor" to tell the system the right action to take. In order to perform its tasks, **the reinforcement learning agent** interact with its environment through trial and error and received rewards signal.

It is a sequential decision making process. One step after an other, the **agent** gets to make decision, picks action, see how much rewards it gets and optimizes those rewards to obtain the best possible outcome. Sometimes, the **agents** makes a decision now and gets to see if it was a good decision or bad decision only many steps later. 

There is many exemple of **reinforcement learning** that range from managing an investment portfolio to ,and more importantly, playing video/board games better than humans such as Atari games. :video_game: :space_invader: :trophy:

The most fundamental quantity in RL is the rewards that is a scalar feedback signal, here name R_{t}.
